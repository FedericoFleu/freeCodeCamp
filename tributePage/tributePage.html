            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Raymond Kroc life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1902</strong> - October 5, 1902
                    Oak Park, Illinois, U.S.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1960s</strong> - a wave of new fast food chains appeared that copied McDonald's model,
                    including Burger King, Burger Chef, Arby's, KFC, and Hardee's. Kroc became frustrated with the
                    McDonald brothers' desire to maintain a small number of restaurants. The brothers also consistently
                    told Kroc he could not make changes to things such as the original blueprint, but despite Kroc's
                    pleas, the brothers never sent any formal letters that legally allowed the changes in the chain. In
                    1961, he bought the company for $2.7 million, calculated so as to ensure each brother received $1
                    million after taxes. Obtaining the funds for the buyout was difficult due to existing debt from
                    expansion. However, Harry Sonneborn, whom Kroc referred to as his "financial wizard", was able to
                    raise the required funds.

                <li>
                    <strong>1961</strong> - He purchased the fast food company McDonald's
                <li>
                    <strong>1973</strong> - Kroc received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement,
                    and Kroc retired from running McDonald's, While he was looking for new challenges, he decided to
                    return to baseball, his lifelong favorite sport, when he learned that the San Diego Padres were for
                    sale.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1974</strong> - The Padres lost 102 games, yet drew over one million in attendance, the
                    standard of box office success in the major leagues during that era. Their previous top attendance
                    was 644,772 in 1972.[24] The San Diego Union said Kroc was "above all, a fan of his team"
                </li>
                <li><strong>1984</strong> January 14, (aged 81)
                    San Diego, California, U.S.</li>
